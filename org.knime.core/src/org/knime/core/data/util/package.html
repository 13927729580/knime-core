Contains <code>DataCell</code> containers and other utilities.<br>
<br>
The containers are wrapping the Java standard containers (like 
<code>ArrayList</code>, <code>HashSet</code>, <code>HashMap</code>, etc.) 
with the parameters of general type object replaced by the special type
<code>DataCell</code> (where applicable).<br>
<br>
The other utility available in the moment is the 
<code>ObjectToDataCellConverter</code> that allows for creating the proper
<code>DataCell</code> object from another type.<br>
