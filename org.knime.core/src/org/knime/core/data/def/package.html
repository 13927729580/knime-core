<body>
Provides default implementations for all (except 
{@link org.knime.core.data.DataTable DataTable}) abstract 
classes in the data package.<br>
<br>
The default implementations of classes derived from 
{@link org.knime.core.data.DataCell DataCell} just store their
values in members of the appropriate java type (like 
{@link org.knime.core.data.def.DoubleCell DoubleCell} has a private
member of Java type double, etc.).<br>
<br>
The default implementation of {@link org.knime.core.data.DataTable DataTable}
is deprecated and shouldn't be used.
Rather use the {@link org.knime.core.data.container.DataContainer DataContainer} 
(or in the {@link org.knime.core.node.NodeModel NodeModel}'s execute method, the 
{@link org.knime.core.node.BufferedDataTable BufferedDataTable).
