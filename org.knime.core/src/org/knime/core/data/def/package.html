<body>
Provides default implementations for all abstract 
classes in the data package.<br>
<br>
The default implementations of classes derived from DataCell just store their
values in members of the appropriate java type (like DoubleCell has a private
member of Java type double, etc.).<br>
<br>
The default implementation of DataTable is meant to be used for 
testing and debugging purposes only. It stores all data contained in the table
in a (possibly huge!) array of individual DataCells in memory. Only use it when
you know the table is guaranteed to stay small.<br>
Sometimes there is no way around storing the entire data table. If expensive
computations are needed, or if it's just newly created data. In this case, if
it's too much data to store in memory, use the <code>DataContainer</code>.
