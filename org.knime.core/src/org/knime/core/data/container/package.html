		Implementation of a <code>DataContainer</code>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A <code>DataContainer</code> is a buffer that you can use to fill a
		data table. Use this class when you create much (and also just little)
		data and you don't want to bother about a data structure that keeps the
		calculated data. A <code>DataContainer</code> will take care of it, 
		it will memorize the rows that you've added and also buffer it to the 
		disk when the data gets large so that memory gets a bottleneck. 
		Typically, you write code like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
  DataContainer container = new DataContainer();
  container.open(aDataTableSpec);
  for (...) {
    DataRow newRow = calculateRow();
    container.add(newRow)
  }
  container.close();
  DataTable result = container.getTable();
	</pre>
	<p>This package contains also implementations for easy storage of 
	datatables whose columns have changed. For further details on how to use
	them, refer to the description of <a href="../../node/NodeModel.html">
	NodeModel</a> and its execute method.
