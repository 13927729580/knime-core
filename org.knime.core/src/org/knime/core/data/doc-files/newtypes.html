<h1>Data representation in KNIME</h1>
<p>KNIME uses <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a>s to represent data
(each <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> holds one single entity, for
instance a floating point value). An array of <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a>a>s
makes up a <s href="../DataRow.html">DataRow</s>. There are a couple of default
implementations of <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> that hold specific
types of data such as <a href="../def/StringCell.html">StringCell</a>, <a
  href="../def/IntCell.html">IntCell</a>, and <a href="../def/DoubleCell.html">DoubleCell</a>.
The entire data that is passed along nodes in the workflow is exposed in a <a
  href="../DataTable.html">DataTable</a>, containing an usually unknown number
of (equal-length) rows. All elements in a column must be compatible to the type
that is assigned to the column, e.g. they must all be numeric or all must be a
strings. The following figure sketches a <a href="../DataTable.html">DataTable</a>.</p>

<p>The meta information to a <a href="../DataTable.html">DataTable</a>
(number of columns, column specific information) is available through the <a
  href="../DataTableSpec.html">DataTableSpec</a> (acessible via <a
  href="../DataTable.html#getDataTableSpec()">DataTable.getDataTableSpec</a>)
which consists of a set of <a href="../DataColumnSpec.html">DataColumnSpec</a>s
comprising a specific name (a string), type (a <a href="../DataType.html">DataType</a>,
see below), and some (optional) properties such as domain information (mininum,
maximum, possible values), a color handler, and so on for each of the columns.
For further details on these specific classes see their class description and
the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> on how to use them.</p>

<h1><a name="newtypes">New types in KNIME</a></h1>
<p>KNIME allows to define customized types of data, e.g. a <a
  href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> that carries a representation of a
molecule. Specialized data types bring along their own renderer (e.g. to display
the molecular structure), a customized icon (that is displayed, for instance in
a column header to recognize the column's type), and a comparator. In order to
implement a new type in KNIME, generally you have to create two different
classes/interfaces:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An interface derived from <a href="../DataValue.html">DataValue</a>
  defining access method(s) to the generic objects. This will be the base
  interface to the new type and will also expose the meta information (renderer
  and such). Since Java does not allow to specify static members nor methods in
  interfaces (or any other class definition), KNIME will access a member in that
  interface with the following signature using reflection: <pre
    style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">public static final UtilityFactory UTILITY</pre>
  The class <a href="../DataValue.UtilityFactory.html">UtilityFactory</a> has
  methods to retrieve specific information to this type implementation. If you
  do not provide such a member, the reflection mechanism will use the
  information from the super interface, i.e. DataValue (though, no customized
  information is available in this case). We advise to define the <a
    href="../DataValue.UtilityFactory.html">UtilityFactory</a> as an inner class
  of the interface. The new interface should be similar to: <pre>public interface MyDataValue extends DataValue {
    
    /** Derived locally. */
    public static final UtilityFactory UTILITY = new UtilityFactory() {
       ...
    };
    
    /** The interface methods. */
    SomeObject getMyValue();

 }
 </pre></li>
  <li>A class derived from <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> and
  implementing the interface defined in 1. and any <a href="../DataValue.html">DataValue</a>
  interface to which your new type should be compatible to (for instance our new
  molecule type should also be able to return a simple string representation of
  the molecule – it needs therefore to implement <a
    href="../def/StringValue.html">StringValue</a>). The first time the new <a
    href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> is instantiated, KNIME will parse the
  list of implemented <a href="../DataValue.html">DataValue</a> interfaces and
  make the list of compatible <a href="../DataValue.html">DataValue</a>s
  available through the <a href="../DataType.html">DataType</a> that is
  associated with the new cell implementation (which is created at runtime the
  first time the method <a href="../DataType.html#getType(java.lang.Class)">DataType.getType(MyNewCell.class)</a>
  is invoked – either directly or implicitly through <a
    href="../DataCell.html#getType()">MyNewCell#getType()</a>). There are a two
  important issues to respect when defining a new <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a>:

  <ul>
    <li><b>Native value class</b>: A <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a>
    may potentially implement more than just one single <a
      href="../DataValue.html">DataValue</a> interface. There is no natural
    order on the implemented interfaces but one often desires to have a
    “preferred” value class. (Think of the new molecule type from before, which
    is compatible to the new MyDataValue interface but also to <a
      href="../def/StringValue.html">StringValue</a> – both values support a
    customized renderer: Which renderer should KNIME use by default?) To
    overcome this situation, KNIME will attempt to call a static method in the <a
      href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> implementation with the following
    signature and use the returned value as “native” value class. <pre>public static final Class&lt;? extends DataValue&gt; getNativeValueClass()</pre>
    Implement this method and return a <a href="../DataValue.html">DataValue</a>
    class that your <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> is implementing. If
    no such method exists, the order on the implemented values is undefined.</li>
    <li><b>DataCellSerializer&lt;MyCell&gt;</b>: Knime frequently buffers
    data to hard disc since <a href="../DataTable.html">DataTable</a>s can get
    arbitrarily big. By default it uses Java-serialization (the base <a
      href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> implements <tt>java.io.Serializable</tt>).
    Since standard serialization is awfully slow, we support reading/writing
    through an appropriate factory, called <a href="../DataCellSerializer.html">DataCellSerializer</a>.
    KNIME will check for (yet another) static method in your <a
      href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> implementation: <tt>public
    static final DataCellSerializer&lt;MyCell&gt; getCellSerializer()</tt> and if it
    finds such method, it will use the returned factory instead of
    serialization. Note, you also need to have the correct return type, i.e. the
    generic paramater of the <a href="../DataCellSerializer.html">DataCellSerializer</a>
    must be your <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> class. This method is
    called once (the first time such an serializer is used). Be highly
    encouraged to implement it – it pays off!</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: medium">The skeleton for the new <a
      href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> will look
like:</p>
<pre>public class MyCell extends DataCell implements MyValue, StringValue {

    public static final Class&lt;? extends DataValue&gt; getNativeValueClass() {
        return MyValue.class;
    }
    
    public static final DataCellSerializer&lt;MyCell&gt; getCellSerializer() {
        return new DataCellSerializer() {
            public void serialize(MyCell cell, DataOutput output) throws IOException {
                ...
            }
            public MyCell deserialize(DataInput input) throws IOException {
                ...
                return new MyCell(...);
            }
        };
    }
    ...
}</pre>
