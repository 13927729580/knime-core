The meta package contains all classes needed to build a meta node that
encapsulates a meta workflow. We distinguish between <b>MetaIONodes</b> that are
responsible for translating the input/output of the outer workflow to the
inner workflow and the <b>MetaNode</b> itself that holds an internal workflow.
</p>

The following classes belong to the MetaNode:
<ul>
<li>MetaNodeContainer, MetaNode and MetaNodeModel</li>
<li>All MetaNodeFactories ending with the number of input and output ports</li>
</ul>
The MetaNode itself behaves like a normal node. The basic difference is that
the workbench can access the inner workflow of this node. The MetaNodeContainer
accesses the inner meta-workflow through the MetaNode which access the 
underlying MetaNodeModel. Input DataTables are translated from the inports
of the MetaNode in the inner workflow and from its outputs to the outports
of the MetaNode.
<br>
The following classes belong to the MetaIONodes:
<ul>
<li>MetaInputNodeModel, MetaInputNode and MetaInputNodeContainer</li>
<li>MetaOutputNodeModel, MetaOutputNode and MetaOutputNodeContainer</li>
<li>MetaIONode and MetaIONodeContainer</li>
</ul>
<br>
These nodes can only be used inside a MetaWorkflow. They are responsible for 
translating the input at the MetaNode to the inner workflow and resp.
translating the output to the output port of the MetaNode. The MetaInput
and MetaOutput nodes allow to build a fully connected workflow inside a 
MetaNode. The MetaInput- and MetaOutputNode behave like normal nodes. The only
difference is that DataTables and DataTableSpecs are manually set resp. retrieved by 
getter- and setter-methods. DataTables and DataTableSpecs are propagated from
the NodeContainer through the Node to the NodeModel. The Factory of the 
MetaInput and MetaOutputNode produces singletons.
