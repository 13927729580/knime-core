/**
 * General interface for object specifications that are passed along node
 * connections. Most prominent example of such a class is
 * {@link org.knime.core.data.DataTableSpec}, which is used to represent table
 * specification. <code>PortObjectSpec</code> objects represent the
 * information that is necessary during a node's
 * {@link GenericNodeModel#configure(PortObjectSpec[]) configuration step}.
 * They are assumed to be fairly small objects (usually reside in memory) and
 * describe the general structure of {@link PortObject} objects (which are
 * passed along the connections during a node's execution). Both the class of a
 * <code>PortObjectSpec</code> and a {@link PortObject} describe
 * {@link PortType}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Important:</b>Implementors of this interface must also provide a
 * {@link PortObjectSpecSerializer}, which is used to save and load instances.
 * The framework will try to invoke a static method defined in the
 * implementation with the following signature:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  public static PortObjectSpecSerializer&lt;FooPortObjectSpec&gt; 
 *          getPortObjectSpecSerializer(final File directory) 
 *              throws IOException {...}
 * </pre>
 * 
 * If the class does not have such a static method (or it has the wrong
 * signature), an exception will be thrown at runtime.
