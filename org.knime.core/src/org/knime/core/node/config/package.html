<body>
Contains a utility class {@link org.knime.core.node.config.Config} to store 
a general state (i.e. the user settings of all nodes, workflows, prediction 
models, etc.) in form of key-value pairs. The key is always a string, the value 
can be of type DataCell, DataType, and almost all generic types, and also another 
<code>Config</code> object in order to build hierarchical state structures.<br>
All entries extend {@link org.knime.core.node.config.AbstractConfigEntry},
which provides a string representation of the value that can be serialized and 
written out as XML stream to file.
