<body>
Contains hilite classes to maintain hilite events between different views. 
Hilite events are sent between registered listener, e.g. views. These instances
are also able to set 
the hilite status of certain items directly so they are handler and manager 
in one class. Hilite events are based on one or a set of row IDs usually 
retrieved from a data table. See the <b><code>DefaultHiLiteHandler</code></b> 
for an implementation of the hilite handler.
