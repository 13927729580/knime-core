	Contains class for internal use. <br/>
	This package contains classes that intantiated at very beginning of the KNIME
	life cycle when started in Eclipse or as RCP. 
	The CorePlugin class serves as plugin activator to set the workspace path
	in the KNIMEPath class. The KNIMEConstants class will later on look
	at the variables in KNIMEPath to create the log file etc.
	
	<p><b>Note</b>This package is not exported. Dependent plugins won't see any
	of the classes in here.
