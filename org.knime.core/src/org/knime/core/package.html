Contains the API of the core elements like data cells, data tables, nodes, and
all elements the infrastructure of the flow is based on.

In the subpackage <code>data</code> you'll find all definitions of elements 
needed to store and access the actual data (the data that is transported 
through the different nodes in the flow and being analyzed, manipulated, mined,
etc.). These are <code>DataCell</code>s (with their different flavours like
<code>DoubleCells</code>, <code>IntCell</code>, etc.), the interface definitions
for the <code>DataTable</code> (which carries all attribute vectors) and related
classes. There are also default implementations for these data containers,
which are all simple objects storing the data in memory.

The other big subpackage is <code>node</code>. It contains all classes needed
to define the infrastructure of the dataflow. The most important ones are the
<code>Node</code>, which uses the abstract classes <code>NodeModel</code>, 
<code>NodeDialog</code>, and <code>NodeView</code>. These will be implemented
by a designer of a new node for the workflow. <br>
You also find an implementation of a default workflow manager in the 
<code>node</code> package. It is an object that allows for defining flows 
(by adding nodes and connections), and executing the nodes in parallel.

The <code>util</code> subpackage contains all kinds of small utility classes that are useful in many nodes.
