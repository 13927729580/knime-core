Contains the interface definitions of the DataCell and DataTable and related 
classes, used to store and access the actual data.
<p>
A {@link de.unikn.knime.core.data.DataTable DataTable} (see <code>DataTable.java</code>) is used to
pass data along between nodes in the workflow.<br>
<br>
A DataTable has rows and columns. The number of columns is fixed. The
type of data stored in each column is well defined, and each column has
a unique name. Each row consists of a certain number of cells (which
contain the actual data) and a unique row identifier. The data in a
DataTable is read-only.<br>
<br>
A DataTable contains a DataTableSpec (see <code>DataTableSpec.java</code>) 
object which describes the structure of the table (the number of columns, the
column types, etc.) and a RowIterator (see <code>RowIterator.java</code>) which
allows to iterate over the rows of the table and actually access
the data.<br>
<br>
A RowIterator returns a DataRow (see <code>DataRow.java</code>), which allows 
access to each DataCell (see <code>DataCell.java</code>) in this row by index 
(the index of the column). The number of rows is not known up-front, the iterator
indicates when it reaches the end of the table.
There is no random access to rows of the data table. The
underlying source could be sequential and of arbitrary size. Thus the
general DataTable interface doesn't provide any random access methods.<br>
<br>
The DataTableSpec contains the meta information of the data table.
It can be used to query the columns' name, type, and the number of
columns. In addition to that it is also used to pass information
along to connected successors to let them know of the structure of
the table to come. So, if the successor's preparations for execution
(like the settings) depend on the structure of the data table of the
predecessor, it can be set up after it received the DataTableSpec.<br>

<br>
DataCells are of certain type, depending on the type of data appearing
in the corresponding column. For each type of data cell certain objects exist
descriping the cell's properties, capabilities and compatibilities. This is the
<code>DataCell</code> derivative implementing <code>DataValue</code>, which defines how to 
access the value stored in the data cell. And an implementation derived from 
<code>DataType</code> (see <code>DataType.class</code>) holding a list of 
compatible datatypes and providing comparators, renderers, etc.
Read more on datacells <a HREF="doc-files/dataCell.html">here</a> 
and in the <a HREF="doc-files/faq.html">FAQ<a>.
<br>
<br>
Default implementations of DataCells can be found in the <code>data.def</code>
package. These implementations store the value of the cell in a member of the 
corresponding Java data type.<br>
<br>
DataTables could be arbitrary big, thus they shouldn't be copied or
held in memory. <br>
