<body>
Contains the handlers for hilite events. Hilite events are sent 
between registered listener, e.g. views. These instances are also able to set 
the hilite status of certain items directly so they are handler and manager 
in one class. Hilite events are based on one or a set of row IDs usually 
retrieved from a data table. See the <b><code>DefaultHiLiteHandler</code></b> 
for an implementation of the hilite handler.

Please see the parent package for more information on property handlers.
